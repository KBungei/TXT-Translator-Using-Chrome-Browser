# TXT-Translator-Using-Chrome-Browser
Make use of Google Chrome browser translator to translate TXT files.

Open site here https://kbungei.github.io/TXT-Translator-Using-Chrome-Browser/

## Instructions:
Start by clicking "Choose file" and open a txt file from your local storage.
A copy will be loaded to your browser.

NOTE: The original file will not be edited/changed whatsoever, the text file you get when you are done is a completely different file.

The file, if a valid txt, should then be displayed in the middle of screen, the "text area", a *set* number of lines at a time. 1000 being the default.


If you are seeing strange characters like "�����Ϊ" try selecting a different encoding.


The default encoding UTF-8 is widely supported, but you may try UTF-16 which covers more characters.


If you expecting Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese characters, or CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters
and neither of unicode options work, a safe bet would be GBK, or better yet, try the more comprehensive GB18030.

Right click the page, scroll and select "translate to *your default language*".
